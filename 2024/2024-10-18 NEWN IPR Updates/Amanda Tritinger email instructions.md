Hello EWN Researchers,

I hope this message finds you well. As you know, FY24 presented significant funding challenges for the program, severely limiting our ability to fully support existing EWN work units. We appreciate your understanding and flexibility in working with the resources available and are grateful for your resilience and ability to 'make it work' during this fiscal year. In light of these challenges, our end-of-year IPRs will be adjusted. Rather than formal presentations, we request that lead PIs complete the attached EWN IPR slide deck for their research task(s) and submit it by by COB on October 18th. 
 
A template slide deck is attached. The content should generally align with the information in your PMPs, though we understand that FY24 outcomes may be limited. A few key notes on completing the slides are as follows:

Slide 2. Please provide funding level information only for previous years and what you received in FY24. 
Slide 7. The budget column should reflect the total funding received to date, along with an estimate of the funding required for each activity pursued throughout the project's life cycle, including FY24. Please also include activities and deliverables proposed for FY25 on this slide.
Slide 8. We kindly ask that you provide a list of proposed FY25 activities, deliverables, and an estimate of the associated funding for each. As we look ahead to FY25, please keep in mind that there is significant uncertainty regarding funding levels and the timing of a finalized budget. At this point, we are unable to confirm which EWN work units will receive funding next FY, and it's possible that several may not continue into FY25 due to anticipated funding constraints. This may not come as a surprise, given the limited funding many of your projects received in FY24. Rest assured, we will reach out to each of you once we have more clarity on the program's FY25 funding capacity.

Once the slides are submitted, the team will review them and follow up with questions, if we have any.

--To Do--
PPT slides due to the RDE site on 18 Oct at 5 P.M. CT. Please share as a PPT file, NOT a PDF. Also, please contact me for an alternate delivery method if you have difficulty with RDE link below. The preferred naming convention of the PPT file is on the first slide of the attached template. PLEASE DO NOT BE LATE.
